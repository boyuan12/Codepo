# GitHub Clone
## Introduction
This is my try to develop a web application similar to [GitHub](https://github.com), which is where you suppose to find and read this document. I tried my best to implement different essential functionalities that GitHub Provides (See features below for details) as a clone, entire web application is written in Python/Django. I will constantly add more feature to it. Of course there's going to be a lot of bugs, please feel free to open an issue by using issue template, or you can request more feature using feature request template.

## Features
- Authentication (Demo account: username - demo, password - demo)
- Repo
- "Gitt"

Currently, this clone doesn't suppose commit and branches yet. Which suppose to be the most essential for Repository management, but I'm currently work on that right now.
