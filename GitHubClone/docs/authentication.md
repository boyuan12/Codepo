## Authentication Process
Authentication process is very simple and is a common approach. To start, visit `/auth/register/` *(protected by reCAPTCHA)*

Once you filled the form, the website will say "Your account is successfully created, but please check your email to verify your account.", and if you check your email, you would see:

## Forgot Password
As humans, we always forgot passwords. If you forgot password, you can visit `/auth/forgot-password/` to reset your password.
